This library helps you easily create a javascript application to connect the WhatsApp API using service [green-api.com](https://green-api.com/en). You need to get `ID_INSTANCE`and `API_TOKEN_INSTANCE` in the [control panel](https://console.green-api.com) in order to use this library. It's free for developers.

## API

The API corresponds with [REST API](https://green-api.com/en/docs/api/) from green-api since the library wraps own methods as https calls to the service. Therefore using these [docs](https://green-api.com/en/docs/) is highly encouraged.

## Installing

Library supports both browser environment without package managers and Node/Webpack apps with package manager that can handle `require` or `import` module expressions.
For webpack and npm based apps:

```
npm i @green-api/whatsapp-api-client
```

For vanilla html-js website modify index.html:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@green-api/whatsapp-api-client/lib/whatsapp-api-client.min.js"></script>
```

## Importing 

There are several ways to import the library in a project

Using common javascript 
```
const whatsAppClient = require("@green-api/whatsapp-api-client");
```
Using ES6 javascript 
```
import whatsAppClient from "@green-api/whatsapp-api-client";
```
Using typescript 
```
import * as whatsAppClient from "@green-api/whatsapp-api-client";
```

Using browser javascript 
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@green-api/whatsapp-api-client/lib/whatsapp-api-client.min.js"></script>
```

## Authentification

Sending WhatsApp message like any other call to the API requires account registered on [green-api.com](https://green-api.com/en) and authentication completed on mobile WhatsApp app. To register account you have to proceed to the [control panel](https://cabinet.green-api.com/en). After registering you wll get own unique pair of `ID_INSTANCE` and `API_TOKEN_INSTANCE` keys.

WhatsApp mobile app authentication may be achived by using [control panel](https://cabinet.green-api.com). You need to scan QR-code generated within the control panel.

## Examples

Please do not use 'phoneNumber' parameter when calling methods. It is deprecated. Examples below are based on 'chatId' paramemeter

### Send WhatsApp message

Use common javascript

```js
const whatsAppClient = require("@green-api/whatsapp-api-client");

const restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
  idInstance: "YOUR_ID_INSTANCE",
  apiTokenInstance: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE",
});

restAPI.message.sendMessage("79999999999@c.us", null , "hello world").then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

or use browser js script

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@green-api/whatsapp-api-client/lib/whatsapp-api-client.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
    idInstance: "YOUR_ID_INSTANCE",
    apiTokenInstance: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE",
  });
  restAPI.message
    .sendMessage("79999999999@c.us", null, "hello world")
    .then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((reason) => {
      console.error(reason);
    });
</script>
```

Or use ES6 syntax. For node js app, you propably have to add in `package.json` property `"type": "module"`. Notice that all examples below are ES6 based.

```js
import whatsAppClient from "@green-api/whatsapp-api-client";

(async () => {
  const restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
    idInstance: "YOUR_ID_INSTANCE",
    apiTokenInstance: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE",
  });
  const response = await restAPI.message.sendMessage(
    "79999999999@c.us",
    null,
    "hello world"
  );
})();
```

### Using credentials file for `ID_INSTANCE` and `API_TOKEN_INSTANCE` keys (nodejs only!)

You might want to store yours credentials separatedly from code. The library allow you to create a text file with preferred name and location with the format:

```
API_TOKEN_INSTANCE = "MY_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE"
ID_INSTANCE = "MY_ID_INSTANCE"
```

And then pass this file as described below:

```js
const restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
  credentialsPath: "examples\\credentials",
});
```

### Receive notifications using webhook service REST API

```js
import whatsAppClient from "@green-api/whatsapp-api-client";

(async () => {
  let restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
    idInstance: "YOUR_ID_INSTANCE",
    apiTokenInstance: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE",
  });

  try {
    // Receive WhatsApp notifications.
    console.log("Waiting incoming notifications...");
    await restAPI.webhookService.startReceivingNotifications();
    restAPI.webhookService.onReceivingMessageText((body) => {
      console.log(body);
      restAPI.webhookService.stopReceivingNotifications();
      //console.log("Notifications is about to stop in 20 sec if no messages will be queued...")
    });
    restAPI.webhookService.onReceivingDeviceStatus((body) => {
      console.log(body);
    });
    restAPI.webhookService.onReceivingAccountStatus((body) => {
      console.log(body);
    });
  } catch (ex) {
    console.error(ex.toString());
  }
})();
```

### Send WhatsApp file

```js
import whatsAppClient from "@green-api/whatsapp-api-client";

(async () => {
  const restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
    idInstance: "YOUR_ID_INSTANCE",
    apiTokenInstance: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE",
  });
  const response = await restAPI.file.sendFileByUrl(
    "79999999999@c.us",
    null,
    "https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/get-pdb/477388/77f64197-87d2-42cf-9305-14f49c65f1da/s375",
    "horse.png",
    "horse"
  );
})();
```

### Send WhatsApp message and receive webhook

Webhooks are event-based callbacks invoked by green-api server as responses to client API calls. Webhooks support node js and express based apps only.

```js
import whatsAppClient from "@green-api/whatsapp-api-client";
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";

(async () => {
  try {
    // Set http url, where webhooks are hosted.
    // Url must have public domain address.
    await restAPI.settings.setSettings({
      webhookUrl: "MY_HTTP_SERVER:3000/webhooks",
    });

    const app = express();
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    const webHookAPI = whatsAppClient.webhookAPI(app, "/webhooks");

    // Subscribe to webhook happened when WhatsApp delivered a message
    webHookAPI.onIncomingMessageText(
      (data, idInstance, idMessage, sender, typeMessage, textMessage) => {
        console.log(`outgoingMessageStatus data ${data.toString()}`);
      }
    );

    // Run web server with public domain address
    app.listen(3000, async () => {
      console.log(`Started. App listening on port 3000!`);

      const restAPI = whatsAppClient.restAPI({
        idInstance: MY_ID_INSTANCE,
        apiTokenInstance: MY_API_TOKEN_INSTANCE,
      });
      // Send test message that triggers webhook
      const response = await restAPI.message.sendMessage(
        "79999999999@c.us",
        null,
        "hello world"
      );
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
})();
```

There's some cool [examples too](examples/).

## Deploying development environment

Any help with development and bug fixing is appreciated. In order to deploy test-ready environment please make the steps:

1. Сlone repo with `git clone`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Install globally libraries `rollup` for bundled builds.
4. Add webhooks as new dev express via npm `npm install express --save-dev`. Dont forget to delete it before making pull request
5. Create .env file in root folder and add environment variables using example file [env.example](env.example)
6. Add `"type": "module"` to the package.json

## Build

Compile browser and node|webpack versions with single command:

```
npm run build
```

Publish to npm if you have access

```
npm publish
```
